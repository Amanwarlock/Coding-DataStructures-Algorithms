## Guide and Sample Response

    > What is the compensation you are looking at ? Ball park figure in mind?

        > TIP: Don't answer that and don't give a number. Push back on them. 

        > Samples:

                > Hey I'm just really curious, what's the compensation band for this position?

                > Hey I actually haven't put much thought into this. I've been busy preparing for the interviews.
                    This is really important thing, so let me take some time to just think about this and can we revisit this later?

                > If the recuiter give you a range, don't say its great. But just say its low or you had different expectations. Try to be as open as possible

                > I'm just curious what's the compensation band for this position?

                > I wanted to understand the compensation philosophy first

Ms. Alexandra J. Manager


Human Resources Manager


ABC Company


Dear Ms. Lawrence:


Thank you for the offer to join ABC Company. I am grateful for the opportunity and appreciate your confidence in my abilities and qualifications. I was looking forward to joining your team. However, I must regretfully inform you that I am withdrawing my previous acceptance.


It was a hard decision, but I have received an offer from another organization that more closely aligns with the opportunities I sought throughout my job search.


Thank you again for the offer, and I wish you well with your continued search for the right candidate.
