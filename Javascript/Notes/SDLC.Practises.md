## Debuggin Best Practises:
    > First come up with a hypothesis i.e. what is causing a bug
    > Try to reproduce it locally and analyze


## Code Reviews
    > Check sytle guides followed
    > Check if incompatible lib
    > Console.logs
    > Code optimizations
    > Catch bugs
    > DB query check
    > Comments

    ## Testing and Debugging
        > What are source maps in front end
        > How will you cache in browser and once you update your code how will discard the cache (cache busting -- HTTP body, header data)
        > How will you debugg why your front-end app is loading slow
        > WHat are the dev tools you used
        > Semantic versioning how will you use
        > How will you fix a bug
        > How will you reduce bundle size
        

    ## System Design
        > How will you measure scalability? How will you estimate how much to scale and when to scale?
        > When will you use monolithic
        > Advantages of Monolithic vs Microservices
        > Pros and cons of serverless like lambda
        > How will you keep yourself updated with the technology (what kind of blogs you read)


    ## Behavioural 
        > Tell me about a time you had conflict with someone and what you did about that?
        > Tell me about the time you made a mistake
        > What did you when you disagreed?
        > What is the difficult challenges you faced?
